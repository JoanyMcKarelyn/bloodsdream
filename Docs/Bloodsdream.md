# Credits and Thanks

All is free to use. But if you want to use the following meshes or textures, make sure to credit: 

- [MOP Team and Morrowind Optimization Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45384), for Murberius' hair mesh (/jo/b_n_imperial_m_hair_murberius.nif)
- [Remiros and Intelligent Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469), for Murberius' head texture (/jo/TX_B_N_Imperial_M_H07_mur.bmp)

Extra thanks to: 

- If not for Morrowind Modding Madness 2022 and [Team Gobblin Goblins](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51940), I would never have thought of doing a dungeon-quest-adventure mod. 
- The author of [Dynamic Timescale](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48287), for adding the interop!
